This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to implicit type coercion when handling null values in arithmetic operations. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers but doesn't explicitly check for null or undefined inputs.  This can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with data from external sources or user input. The solution file provides a corrected version with explicit null checks and improved error handling.
